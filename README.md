This is a simple Next.js project with 3 pages:
- Home page - shows list of all items
- Create page - create new item
- Details page - item details

To run this project, you need to install it locally using npm, and then run it:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Also, you need to create `.env.local` file with environment variables, `.env.example` is an example of how that file should look.

If you open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser, you will see home page with List of all items.

A preview of this application is also deployed on Vercel and you can see it [here](https://list-app-gules.vercel.app/)
